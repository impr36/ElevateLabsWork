## Summary
A hands-on analysis of a phishing email sample completed as part of the Cyber Security Internship. The objective was to identify social engineering techniques, email spoofing indicators, header discrepancies, malicious links/attachments, and provide remediation recommendations.


## Deliverables

- `artifacts/sample-email.txt` — raw email text used for analysis
- `report/screenshots/` — screenshots documenting the analysis steps


## Tools used
- Online header analyzer (e.g., MXToolbox Message Header Analyzer, Google Messageheader analyzer)
- A text editor (VS Code / Notepad++)
- Web browser (for link inspection)
- `pandoc` (optional) to convert markdown to PDF


## How to view
1. Open `report/phishing-analysis-report.md` to read the full analysis.
2. Open the screenshots inside `report/screenshots/` to follow the step-by-step process.
