# 🛡️ Task 8: VPN Setup and Privacy Protection

## 📘 Objective
The main objective of this task is to **understand how Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)** help in maintaining **privacy, encryption, and secure communication** over the internet.  
Through hands-on implementation, this activity demonstrates how VPNs protect user data by encrypting network traffic, hiding IP addresses, and securing connections from potential eavesdroppers.

---

## 🧰 Tools Used
- **ProtonVPN (Free Tier):** For creating a secure and encrypted VPN connection.  
- **Windscribe (Optional Alternative):** Another reliable free VPN service.  
- **Verification Tool:** [https://whatismyipaddress.com](https://whatismyipaddress.com) — to confirm IP address change.  
- **Operating System:** Windows 10 (or any compatible OS).

---

## ⚙️ Steps Overview
1. **Sign Up** for a free VPN service (ProtonVPN or Windscribe).  
2. **Download and Install** the VPN client on your system.  
3. **Login and Connect** to any available VPN server (preferably the closest location).  
4. **Verify IP Change** using [whatismyipaddress.com](https://whatismyipaddress.com).  
5. **Browse Securely** and confirm encrypted traffic.  
6. **Disconnect VPN** and observe changes in browsing speed and IP address.  
7. **Research VPN Features** such as encryption, tunneling protocols, and privacy mechanisms.

## 🔑 Key Concepts
- **VPN (Virtual Private Network):** Creates a secure and encrypted tunnel between your device and the internet.  
- **Encryption:** Protects your online data from interception (commonly AES-256).  
- **Tunneling Protocols:** Rules that define how data travels securely (e.g., OpenVPN, WireGuard).  
- **Privacy and Anonymity:** VPN masks the user’s real IP address, enhancing privacy.  
- **Network Security:** Ensures safe data transmission, even over public Wi-Fi networks.

---

## 📈 Observations
- The VPN successfully **masked the real IP address** and displayed a new virtual location.  
- **Network traffic was encrypted**, preventing interception or monitoring.  
- A **slight drop in speed** was observed due to encryption overhead.  
- Disconnecting restored the actual IP and full bandwidth.

## 🧩 Conclusion
Through this practical exercise, we gained a clear understanding of how **VPNs safeguard online communication and user privacy**.  
They act as a **protective layer** against data breaches, surveillance, and cyber threats by encrypting data traffic and concealing real network identities.  
Although free VPNs have some limitations such as slower speeds and restricted servers, they effectively demonstrate the **importance of encryption and anonymity** in today’s digital environment.
