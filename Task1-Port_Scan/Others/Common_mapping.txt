Common mappings:

22 — SSH (may be fine if key auth and strong config)

80 — HTTP (if present, inspect whether redirecting to HTTPS)

443 — HTTPS (check cert, TLS version)

23 — Telnet (insecure — immediate upgrade recommended)

21 — FTP (plaintext; prefer SFTP/FTPS)

161 — SNMP (community strings — risky if default)

3306 — MySQL (should not be open to LAN if unnecessary)

3389 — RDP (potentially risky if exposed and weak auth)
